#### DCTNet
#### This file contains MATLAB codes that generate audio DCTNet feature. 
#### 1. "bird_song_example" folder contains 4 bird song wav file, ADCTNet and DCTNet feature code.
#### 2. "handel_example" folder contains codes to generate 2-layer ADCTNet and DCTNet feature for music handel in MATLAB.
#### 3. "plot_in_paper" folder contains MATLAB codes to generate ADCTNet, DCTNet, MFSC, LFSC, ERB-rate and scattering transform feature, and a data mat. file. 
#### To generate MFSC, LFSC, ERB-rate features for comparison, we need voicebox MATLAB toolbox. To generate scattering transform feature, we need scatnet MATLAB toolbox. This folder can generate figures appear in paper: "Adaptive DCTNet for Audio Signal Classification", "DCTNet and PCANet for Acoustic Signal Feature Extraction".
